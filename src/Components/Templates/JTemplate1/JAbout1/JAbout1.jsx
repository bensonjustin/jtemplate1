          Thanks for visiting my about page! I’m Andrew Dewis, a freelance coder
          based in Honolulu who specializes in React, Angular, and CSS. On this
          page, you’ll find answers to frequently asked questions about the
          world of freelance coding.

          <h1>What is a freelance coder?</h1>
          <p>
            A freelance coder is a person who is self-employed and gets paid for
            creating software content for businesses, individuals, and websites.
          </p>
          <h1>How did I become a freelance coder?</h1>
          <p>
            To get started as a freelance coder, you have to build a portfolio
            of high-quality coding samples that are relevant to how you want to
            make a living as a freelance coder. For example, if you want to get
            paid to code health and wellness sites, you will need coding samples
            that are focused on health and wellness. In 2010, I began guest
            hosting on popular blogs like Search Engine Journal, Search Engine
            Watch, and Social Media Examiner. By 2015, I had added Content
            Marketing Institute, CrazyEgg, HubSpot, Moz, Salesforce, and
            Unbounce to my portfolio, which allowed me to attract clients who
            needed coding content for their websites.
          </p>
          <h1>How do freelance coders find work?</h1>
